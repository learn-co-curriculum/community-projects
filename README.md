# Community Projects

## Introduction

You've polished up your portfolio projects and have a working personal website - now what? This
lesson includes a few suggestions for what you can do to continue building your online presence
while honing your skills.

## Hackathons

[Hackathons][] are hacking marathons with a particular theme where you build something from scratch.
They are often very short - taking place over a single day or weekend, so they don't require a
significant time commitment. While they often include strong competition, there can be good prizes
at stake. Hackathons are often sponsored by tech companies, as well, and you may gain access to services
just participating in one.

While it is fun to compete, winning isn't the really the goal here. As you are still learning and practicing,
hackathons can be a great test of your abilities. They force you to think on your feet and prioritize
tasks. They can help you practice getting a project to a minimum viable product. Themed hackathons
can also help you think of useful projects you might not have thought of otherwise.

Beyond additional practice, hackathons can be a great opportunity to network and get your name out there.
Larger hackathons can include mentors - members of the tech community that have made themselves available
to help - and free webinars specifically available to participants.

Check out [DevPost's hackathon listings][] and [Major League Hacking][] to see what hackathons are coming
up in the near future.

Try challenging yourself by joining a hackathon team! The challenges you face during hackathons are also a great
topic for your required blog posts!

## Open Source Projects

Another way to develop your skills is to consider contributing to an open source project or technology. Open
source projects are improved and often maintained by the community around them. These projects are a bit more
open ended - many of them can be fairly involved and require a strong understanding of the technology. However,
contributing to an open source project can be an excellent thing to include on your resume as it shows you are
engaged with the tech community and willing to help. Contributing code to open source projects is also a great
way to get practice creating and following Git workflows.

Projects that are open to contributions will often provide documentation on how they'd like you to contribute. 
The [create-react-app][] NPM package, for example, is open source and includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file detailing
how to help.

Check out [this article on contributing to open source projects to help you get started][getting started]. It is
up to you to find a project that you can contribute to, but there are many available and worthy of consideration.
